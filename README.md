## Historical Weather Data Acquisition

### Overview

The acquisition of historical weather data is the first step in conducting smart analysis on crop fields. Weather data can be correlated with satellite and drone image information to provide a comprehensive understanding of crop health and growth patterns.

### Data Collection

Currently, we obtain historical weather information for two specified dates. This data includes key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and total precipitation collected on both a daily and hourly basis.

### Visualizations

#### Hourly Weather Information Plot

The following plot displays the hourly temperature, humidity, wind speed and total precipitation from the specified dates:
